    "### 1. The Shift Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the shift cipher and how does it work?**  \n",
    "It is a simple and historically significant method of It is a substitution encryption, it works by using the modulo operator to encrypt and decrypt messages. The cipher has a key K, which is an integer from 0 to 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How can you encrypt and decrypt messages using the shift cipher?**  \n",
    "The encryption process works by choosing a key, which is an integer representing the number of positions to shift, then taking each letter in the plaintext and shift it by the key value. If the shift takes a letter beyond the end of the alphabet, start again with the letter A.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The decryption process works by using the same key value, but shift the letters in the opposite direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Important things:  \n",
    "Maintain the letter's case (uppercase or lowercase) during the shift.\n",
    "Spaces and punctuation are usually left unchanged.  \n",
    "To decript do it up the alphabet if you previously shifted down, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are the limitations and vulnerabilities of the shift cipher?**  \n",
    "The limitations and vulnerabilities are: \n",
    "- There are limited key space because the alphabet has only 26 letters, so there are only 25 possible keys (k = 0 doesn't change the text). This makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.\n",
    "- Because of it's simplicity and becuase it can easily broken using modern encryption techniques, is not suitable for secure communications.\n",
    "- Because the cipher only involves substitution, it's vulnerable to frequency analysis, which means that the letters have predictable frequency distributions. Thus, an attacker can analyze the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext and deduce the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of the shift cipher?**  \n",
    "This cipher is not save to used in today's world, but it can serve as a teaching tool to introduce the concepts of cryptography and encryption or in puzzle games. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How does the shift cipher relate to modular arithmetic?**  \n",
    "There is a relationship between the cipher and the modular arithmetic, when shifting letters in the alphabet, the \"modulo\" operation is implicitly used. In the English alphabet with 26 letters, shifting by 3 positions can be expressed as (letter_index + 3) % 26, where letter_index is the position of the letter in the alphabet. The modulo operation ensures that the shifted letter wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet if it goes beyond 'Z'. This concept is a fundamental aspect of modular arithmetic.\n",

    "### 2. The Substitution Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the substitution cipher and how does it differ from the shift cipher?**  \n",
    "Is a type of encryption technique in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced with another letter, symbol, or number. For example, 'A' might be replaced with 'X,' 'B' with 'Q,' and so on. Substitution ciphers can be more complex than simple letter-for-letter replacements. So the main difference between these cifers is that in one (shift) each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet, and in the other (substitution) the letter are replace with any character. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How can you create a substitution cipher using a keyword or a random permutation?**  \n",
    "Keyword or phrase:    \n",
    "Create a unique mapping of each letter in the alphabet to a letter in the keyword or phrase. Repeated letters are omitted, and the remaining letters are added to the end. For example, if the keyword is \"KEYWORD,\" the mapping might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "- Cipher: KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Permutation:  \n",
    "Shuffle the letters of the alphabet to create a one-to-one mapping, this will be your encyption key. The recipient of the message would need the same key to decrypt the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the substitution cipher?**  \n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "- Can provide a basic level of security for casual communication.\n",
    "- Different keys can be used for different messages.\n",
    "- Has a lot of combinations to choose from to encrypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Vulnerable to frequency analysis, making it relatively easy to break.\n",
    "- Limited key space, especially for smaller alphabets.\n",
    "- Not suitable for securing sensitive or important data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How can frequency analysis be used to break a substitution cipher?**  \n",
    "It can break it by analyzing the frequency at which letters or symbols appear in the cipher text. By identifying patterns in the cipher text, such as the most frequently occurring symbol, guesses can be made about the substitutions used and eventually decode the message. In most natural languages, certain letters occur more frequently than others. For examples in english 'E' is the most common letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Can you provide an example of a historical use of the substitution cipher?**  \n",
    "The nomenclator chifer is an example. It was named after the public official who announced the titles of visiting dignitaries, this cipher uses a small code sheet containing letter, syllable and word substitution tables, sometimes homophonic, that typically converted symbols into numbers. Nomenclators were the standard fare of diplomatic correspondence, espionage, and advanced political conspiracy from the early fifteenth century to the late eighteenth century. \n",

    "Is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher that combines elements of both the shift cipher and substitution cipher. In the affine cipher, each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a new letter based on a mathematical formula.  \n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "Write a Python function `break_lfsr_stream_cipher(ciphertext, taps)` that takes a string `ciphertext` and a list of integers `taps` as input and attempts to break the LFSR stream cipher by performing a known-plaintext attack. The function should return the most likely plaintext obtained by decrypting the ciphertext using the correct taps.\n",
