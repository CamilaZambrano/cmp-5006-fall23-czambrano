    "### The Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the extended Euclidean algorithm and how does it work?**\n",
    "- The extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension of the standard Euclidean algorithm. It is primarily used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers but also calculates coefficients that represent the linear combination of the two numbers, which is helpful in solving modular equations. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "    - Given two integers a and b, it repeatedly replaces a by b and b by the remainder of the division a/b until b becomes 0. At this point, the GCD is the absolute value of the last non-zero remainder.\n",
    "    - During this process, coefficients x and y are also computed such that ax + by = GCD, where x and y are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Explain how the extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the modular inverse of a number.**\n",
    "- To find the modular inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm', you can use the extended Euclidean algorithm. The modular inverse exists if and only if the GCD of 'a' and 'm' is 1 (they are coprime). Here's how it works:\n",
    "    - Apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to 'a' and 'm' to find coefficients x and y such that ax + my = 1 (since GCD(a, m) must be 1 for a modular inverse to exist).\n",
    "    - If GCD(a, m) is not 1, then the modular inverse does not exist.\n",
    "    - If GCD(a, m) is 1, then 'x' is the modular inverse of 'a' modulo 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Prove that this algorithm find the modular inverse**\n",
    "- The algorithm works because of BÃ©zout's identity, which states that for any two integers 'a' and 'b' such that GCD(a, b) = 1, there exist integers 'x' and 'y' such that ax + by = 1. \n",
    "- So, when GCD(a, m) is 1, it implies that 'a' and 'm' are coprime, and there exist integers 'x' and 'y' that satisfy ax + my = 1. \n",
    "- This 'x' is the modular inverse of 'a' modulo 'm'.\n",
