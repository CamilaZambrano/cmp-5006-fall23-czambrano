All team members contributed to the project, we made multiple Zoom and Discord calls and designed the database diagram, box diagram, and flowchart. Then we shared different ideas for the analysis (like brainstorming) and wrote them down in a one-drive Word document. Then we divided the questions so each person composed all the brainstormed ideas in one final complete cohesive answer.
