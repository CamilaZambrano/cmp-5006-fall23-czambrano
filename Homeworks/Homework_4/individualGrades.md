Members: Alejandra Ospina, Joel del Castillo, Carlos Montiel, Juan SÃ¡nchez, and Camila Zambrano.

All team members contributed to the project, made multiple Zoom and Discord calls, and designed the database, box diagram, and flowchart. Then we shared different ideas
on the questions (like brainstorming) and wrote them down in a one-drive Word document. Then we divided the questions so each person composed all the brainstormed ideas in
one final complete cohesive answer.
